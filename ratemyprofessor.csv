Haines,3.7,4.1,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,His class sucks and so does he. I have nothing else to say about him. Sum up
Huynh,3.7,3.5,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,He wants you to follow his lecture notes strictly - but to understand the notes after class - you need the book. He loves the subject and does not leave the class till you are 10 mins beyond lecture time. Easy grader though. TA will grade all answers right even if they are wrong - so you can easily score in assignments.
Harrison,3.3,2.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Taking his Assembly class. He knows his stuff but does a rather poor job communicating his knowledge to the students. His lectures are extremely boring. His powerpoints are rather pathetic and barely helpful. The main textbook is very rarely used (I wouldn't bother buying it)
Karrah,3,3.1,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,"I can't believe he has a job here. Our first assignment grade was delayed 2 weeks because he was waiting for a TA. Not to mention you literally can't understand him due to his intense accent. Everyone feels awkward when he asks questions because no one actually knows what he's saying. His ""teaching"" style consists of reciting powerpoints on screen."
Chaffin,2.6,4.4,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Really cares about students. Knows her stuff.
Fonseka,3.7,3.7,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,One of the best professors at UTD

Mili,2.9,3.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,She is so nice handsome and cute. Really cares about your learning. She is strict on the homeworks. She is uncompromising about cheating on the projects.

Assmann,3,3.6,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,It's a lot of information and that can be exceptionally tough but Dr. Assman was wonderful. He is passionate about what he teaches and it's contagious! He is a bit quiet so do sit in the front and try to learn! Love him!

Berliner,3.7,3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,She's really nice but DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS if you don't care for literature. I failed the midterma and the paper was hard. You have to read A LOT. Contrary to comments below
Boltrushek,5,1.5,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,pretty easy everything is a completion grade except for the 2 major research essays but still it was ok
Channell,4.6,2.8,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,He's an engineer.  So
Chapman,4.1,2.8,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Phenomenal teacher. UTD should hire him full time. Knows his material and knows how to teach. It's not just about reading the books a lot of understanding comes from his great lectures.
Cohen,3.9,4.1,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,I have taken two classes with this professor and enjoyed both. He can get long-winded sometimes but only because he is passionate about what he does. He can come across like a know-it-all

Melton,3.2,3.9,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,He is very nice and always willing to help

Richard,2.6,2.6,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,I think most of the complaints on here are about the structure.  It will feel like the professor doesnt do much because he has so much class discussion and group presentations during the semester.  Bottom line of the class show up
Dieckmann,4.2,3.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,i took him for chem 1 and 2 and he's great at lecturing. He is vague sometimes though

Beron,2.9,3.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,This is basically intro microeconomics with a sports twist on questions. It's pretty basic stuff and there's a lot of busy work in terms of homework problem sets. That said
Moltz,2.8,4.5,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Good class
Biewer,3.3,4.6,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,His honors ochem class for both semesters was well worth it. He relates course work to real life application which is both fascinating and appreciated. You need to understand the material
Zhang,3.3,2.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Overall a good teacher. Lectures were good
Rockett,4.6,2.2,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,I had Dr. Rockett at TCU for Strategic HR Mgt. It was one of the best classes I have taken at TCU. She explains things well and follows the textbook closely. Tests are straight forward. She always invites questions during lecture
Savitz,4,1.8,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,One of the best professors I ever had at this school.  Really knows his stuff.  Have extensive real world experience which makes the course ever so much more interesting and useful.  I would recommend hands down!
Prager,3.2,3.4,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,I thought the class will be boring but it was great! She lectures and likes when we contribute with our discussions. She is very kind and I love her taste for fashion. I feel very bad barely passing her class
Jacobs,4.4,2.6,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,Great professor. Has much experience in the field which makes for interesting lectures. Has interviewed hundreds of drug dealers and it's hilarious when he reads the interview notes out in class. This was my favorite class by far. 2 test and a presentation (with a partner). Attendance is important! Taking his victimless crime class.
Goodness,2.6,4.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,This class is impossible. I cannot make above a &quot;C&quot; on any of the exams although I do read all of the chapters and attend all classes the multiple choice answer options are &quot;true&quot; &quot;mostly true&quot; &quot;false&quot; or &quot;mostly false&quot; which I think could be debatable but don't try talking to her about it b/c she is one of the most egotistical people I have ever m
Mortenson,3.1,3.2,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Her lectures are based more on the East Asia culture and history. 10% of the grade is based on attendance and class participation. She was an easy grader for me but my friends found her a tough grader. Always ready to help if you drop by her office hours.
Daescu,3.1,3.7,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,He is an excellent professor with super IQ but when comes to teaching and conveying the content to students he is less than par. I recommend to take his course if you are planning to pursue a PHD in algorithms. His grading criteria is clear . If you screw up in midterms he will conduct a final exam where you can improve your grades.
Ho,3.8,3.1,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,I loved his class. The class topic may not have been the most interesting I've ever had
Bray,2.8,4.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,He REALLY loves statistics

Troutman,4.7,2.4,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,Useful class. She talks very fast though
Curry,4.7,2.5,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Attendance is a portion of the grading.  She is nice but grades fairly hard.  Lecture style is mostly discussion.  Assignnments require lots of reading and writing response type paragraphs. Midterm & final are take home and written eassys over the course readings & discussions. Course not difficult just lots of writing to do.
Gartstein,3.7,4.2,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Extremely hard and stressful take home test

Chung,2.4,4,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Professor Cheng is a really nice guy. He know his stuff but doesn't know how to teach. His TA is extremely tough she graded our exam really hard. Come to class and you have a chance to make a 70 else you are screwed. 2 exam and 1 project.

Redman,4.2,3.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,He is one of the best teachers I've ever had. He is very knowledgeable and if you just sit and listen he has loads and loads of interesting information to teach you. I'm an atec major so took the class for fun. It's a very hard class but if you truly show interest and participate you will do well. To make an A though you need to go above and beyond

Ng,3.9,4.1,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Grades based on a bell curve. I have managed to do fine by simply doing the homework and attending lectures. Not a blow off class. Extremely available to students that ask questions online and in person. Answers questions in a friendly manner. He uses the Socratic method in some lectures. I would definitely take him again.
Stewart,4.1,3.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,I really enjoyed his sense of humor. I wish he was still at UTD. =( He's the only teacher whose class I really loved going to.
Woodard,3.9,2.6,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Prof. Woodard made class very interesting. He did spend a lot of time telling personal anecdotes but they usually had something to do with the material. His pop quizzes were very easy. The tests were extremely easy as well.  The bonus questions were the only difficult things about the class. They were random questions having nothing to do w/ gov't.

Hafer,4.3,1.9,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Dr. Hafer is Awesome! Show up for class and you won't have any problem passing. No penalty if you don't show up. Just keep up with material/notes.

Rabe,3.9,3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,He was all about himself. You did things his way and just learned to agree with him. Kinda condescending to women.

Lomber,3.3,3.2,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,I took his class 3 yrs ago and I've never has a worse teacher.

Dess,3,4.6,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Not a good experience
Tullock,4.6,3.4,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,In this class and so miserable! Read over 300 pages for a 50 question exam full of trick questions. I needed a upper level elective & this was all that was offered in the summer. Tests are excruciating. 2 (5-7 page) papers & despite my  undergrad being in English he marks all over your paper. Lectures are not engaging. Don't ignore this warning!
MacAlevey,2.6,3.7,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,There is not enough room to explain how much I adore this professor. I've been sitting in on the lectures for this class to prepare for next semester. Dr. MacAlevey is my favorite Physics professor so far

He links all the materials you have learnt in different courses together to give you a comprehensive view of computer science.

Kane,4.5,2.6,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Very sweet professor. Gives 1 quiz a week but if you read you will have no problem. Cares about her students and knows her material.

Chandler,2.1,4.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,It is unfortunate that she is currently the only professor at the university that teaches this required class. Unless you are a diagnostician you will never use any of the massive amount of material you cover either. The work is that of 3 classes and the tests are 10 pages of short answers. It is not challenging
Linsteadt,3.9,3.6,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Prof. Linsteadt is a great professor. I learned a lot from his class. He made the class fun even though there were a lots of information.

Sachs,3.8,2.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Seemed okay at first but she was very scattered in my class. Didn't really like the group work topics & heard a lot of complaining from people. Wasn't as knowledgeable as she should be  about the terms she was teaching. Too much talking to students and not enough of her own teaching.

They are fun and can bring you out of your shell
Majumdar,2.7,2.7,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,No he isn't specific on anything because he is extremely open minded and accomodating to his students. He doesn't post grades but he would send back a grade to whoever turned the group ppr in. He throws jokes in the whole time he's lecturing. He engages his students in group conversation and promotes simulations for learning instead of book work.

Miller,5,3,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,Take this teacher. She wants you to learn
Chung,3,3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Professor Cheng is a really nice guy. He know his stuff but doesn't know how to teach. His TA is extremely tough she graded our exam really hard. Come to class and you have a chance to make a 70 else you are screwed. 2 exam and 1 project.
Dawande,3.9,2.5,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Took class online. Never used the book. Assignments challenging and are basically harder versions of the tutorials. Find a buddy in the class to work these with. Case studies are also hard
Scott,3.8,3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Very tough prof. You almost have to memorize the book. Lots of readings. Very hard tests. Really boring way of teaching. If you can stay away.
Bihari,2.3,2,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,This teacher is not helpful at all.  I do have a passion for this subject and this teacher made me dislike this class.  She is not willing to help students or answer questions.  Grading policy is unclear.  Professor ignored emails from our entire class and wouldn't clarify information about final exam topics.
Dave,4,4,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Though a nice guy
Ozden,1.4,4.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,class is so boring
Kalyanaraman,3.5,2,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Teaches straight out of the book. Very generous on grading. Online quizzes are a little difficult since they are detailed questions from the book. Exams are not bad

Koshevnik,3.8,2.5,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Yuly was nice and yeah he knew my name quick but that was about where the good ended for me. He focuses so much on writing notes on the board and going by his lesson plan that if you ask a question you are not going to get a clear answer. His practice tests are nothing like the exams and his lecture is almost impossible to follow. Just don't do it
Zhonglan,1.6,4.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,It is an absolute mystery how someone like her gets to teach an important course like this. Maybe

Wilson,4.6,2.9,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,"Dr. Wilson is tough but his intellect is sharp.  He is approachable and is open to general discussion without heavy criticism.  HI is supposed to teach you how to become a historian and so expect to be challenged - this is not an ""easy"" class.  Sassy yet astute"
Holmes,3.6,2.7,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,My grandmother passed away and her funeral was the day of the final exam. Dr. Holmes would not allow me to take the exam at a later date
Ghani,1.7,2,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Horrible. How is he an instructor at UTD? save your money and your sanity and avoid this loose canon. Ridiculously pathetic in terms of a teacher.

Cavusoglu,1.6,4.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Worst Prof ever. His accent is really bad. Don't waste your time. Only reads his slides. Just google the topic and learn much better. I guess he spends more time to his hair than his students. I am thinking how hard could it be a prof when I see these people. I believe after a week I could teach much better than him.
Heroy,2.6,2,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,very easy class. i only come 6 times through out the semester & still made an A because there is no point coming to class. His lectures is very boring & you will learn nothing. NEVER use book ( I WASTED 115$ on books & i never open them) & i agrees the final exam sux.. HE GAVE the wrong review UGH!! EASY A class to boost up ur GPA..
Katz,3.4,3.8,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Dr. Katz's class is not that bad. I am surprised people would complain about this class because it's pretty straightforward and easy if you study. Term paper/project is interesting and kind of fun when you get the hang of writing in IPA. TA is super helpful & Dr. Katz is very funny and fair. Required class for all SPAU majors but have no fear!!
Tamil,3.6,2.7,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Course: Wireless Sensors and Networks. Easy A. Learnt many important things like IOT
Barden,3.9,2.7,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Professor John Barden has easily been the most inspirational teacher that I have had at UTD. His lectures

Ridge,5,1,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Chief Ridge is one of the friendliest people on Earth. The class is easy and can be dry but she brings in some great guest speakers and has fun hands-on activities. She works with students and talks to many outside of class about careers in law enforcement. She's a great resource as well if you are interested in a CJ career.

Lane,3,4.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Dean Lane cares about her students and is a great teacher.  I came to her with a personal problem and she helped me through it.  ARHM 1100 is a required class and you can easily get an A if you show up.
Wang,2.1,2.5,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,The professor has some very fixed opinions regarding his subject. It is such a diverse subject that I found this narrow approach baffling
Briante,3.6,3.1,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,Briante tends to teach the same thing to her grad & undergrad classes. The difference is amount of reading. Workshops are occasionally productive
Boots,4.9,2.6,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,Dr. Boots is an exceptional professor. Her class is very inspirational and rewarding on many levels. She acknowledges her students as real people with different backgrounds and is sensitive when it comes to the hard subjects that you will learn and discuss in class.

Gossin,4,3.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Very easy class
Nason,3.5,2.9,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Professor Nason is so nice! She is always very understanding that we all have lives outside of school. Her exams are half take home short essays and the other half a T/F and short definition exam. She uses readings from the book

Allen,4.1,1.7,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Pr. Allen's class is the best class I've taken at UTD. His teaching style is really interesting and his class is so much fun.

Wood,4.8,2.3,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,Ms Wood is super cool and very smart. She really seems to care about her students and I learned a lot from her about writing college level essays. She seems to be interested in political stuff. Kind of radical
Richard,3,2,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,I think most of the complaints on here are about the structure.  It will feel like the professor doesnt do much because he has so much class discussion and group presentations during the semester.  Bottom line of the class show up
Gaither,3.8,1.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Easy class. One final take home exam. Attendance wasn't required. He is a retired judge and Army Ranger and he has the stories to tell... Its like spending an hour and a half everyday with your grandpa with a test at the end. Take his class.
McIntyre,4.8,3,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,I came from a sociology and music background from undergrad. Systems Neuroscience was my very first neuro course I had taken

Anderson,4.7,2.7,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Great teacher! Easy to approach
Marsh,2.9,3.7,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Tested over random material but he's easier than Spiro. Lectures are the most boring thing ever and nobody shows up. He asks random questions during lecture and expects everyone to anwer back in unison.

Vora,3,3.5,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,her class is fun

She is very willing to meet one on one with students and is extremely encouraging and passionate about her subject.
Bortz,3.8,3.7,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,Professor Bortz is the best. No doubt one of the best at UTD. I've yet to meet a professor that cares more about her students than her. Intermediate II is difficult no matter who teaches it

Atahan,4,3,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,This class was an intro to VB without prior programming experience needed so it's not a hard class at all.  If you're new to programming it may be a little more work for you.  Pelin is very easy on the eyes and was the only reason I attended class. Take her in the Winter if possible...SWEATER TIME!!!
Basu,4.8,1.5,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,This teacher made the class very easy. She was flexible with due dates and gave you extra time if you needed it. Most of the class time was apent on writing your essays

Izen,5,2.7,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,He curves the class so that 80 and above  is an A. There is a six flags report that is a pain in the butt. Izen is very helpful and nice. He is a bit odd at times
Caldwell,4.5,1,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Posted ppt notes online so there wasn't much incentive to go to class since he just went over the slides.
Kehoe,4.2,2.4,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Kehoe is the sweetest professor you will probably ever meet
Siklar,4.9,1.5,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,The weekly assignments require that you put effort and thought into the class each week. The lectures are not the most exciting but by the end of the class
Wong,1.3,3.9,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,I could not understand him.  Your attendance is mandatory; his is sporadic.  The instructions for projects say you can ask questions; he will take off five points for each question you ask.  One cannot read anything that he writes on the whiteboard.  Students are required to generate test cases before knowing what they are.  Don't take his class.

Ring,3.9,2.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,This professor has apparently changed her class policies. There are three exams + a paper. Exams involve linking pairs of terms together. No attendance policy

McConnell,4.2,3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Not the best teacher in the UTeach program. Not very helpful and doesn't go out of his way to make sure you understand what is needed on the assignment. If you need a sense of direction his not the one. Don't recommend taking him.
Pathrose,3,2.5,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,difficult to understand and he's not fair when grading. made mistakes on his test but wouldnt credit us for the correct answer
Umit,2.5,4,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Attendance not mandatory but there are pop quizzes. Three exams and three cases in a semester. Strong accent requires time to get used to. Use curve to determine final grade. Not recommended if you're not hard-working students.
Moller,3.5,2.7,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,He is AMAZING! I have no idea what others are talking about. He is one of the best professors I have ever taken. He loves his students and wants everyone to get an A in the class. He is sweet and addresses every concern. He posts notes and lecture recordings and also provides the text book for free! Who does that. I will take him again if I can.

Vanbeveren,4,2.4,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Great professor! The class was actually more interesting than I expected. She gives a test review which is exactly what will be on the test. I studied hours before and made an A on the tests. She is retiring
Choate,4.6,3.1,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,Great class. Opportunity to use my job as my co-op site. Developed goals with supervisor. Mentoring by mick. Led to management trainee position after graduating.

Yue,2.9,2,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Couldn't understand a word this guy says.  He's SOOO boring too.  The only time I recommend actually coming to class is when you meet in the computer rooms to go over the assignments.  He was fair though

Wan,1,1,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Speeks very little english
Keith,3.6,3.7,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,Ok Professor Keith is very knowledgable and approachable HOWEVER her tests are not for the faint of heart. I will say that she does give you a review but for heaven sakes on the exam each question actually consists of about 6 questions and you must address each one. On top of it all she likes her papers SINGLE-SPACED. Whew
Bernardin,3.6,3.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,very old methods of teaching. Most of them is SLIDE teaching! Not a very good teaching style. Did not learn much at all!

Breen,2.5,3.6,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,I would recommend going to class because 5 points out of 100 for your final grade is dependent on attendance. This class isn't difficult per say
Harpham,4.2,4.7,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Review sessions for exams are extremely helpful. He's always willing to help you if you'll take the time to go to his office hours. Reading is especially important - don't fall behind. He assigns a lot of reading
Champagne,4.9,2.8,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Dr. Champagne is the best professor I have ever taken at UTD. I've taken every single class he has offered.

He also looks very much like Edward Norton.
Patterson,4.6,1.1,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,This class is very easy. Just show up and participate in group activities for the day. That's all she expects from you.

Larue,2.3,3.8,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,This class was a mistake. Larue makes everything  harder than it needs to be. She seems to spend more time lecturing about behavior and respect than she does about the artwork. I thought this class was going to be fun

Tests are very long...one of them took me two hours...and I still wasn't finished completely.  He rewards you for working hard and for your efforts.  You must do the required homework to pass.

Sasson,4.5,2.5,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,He posts lectures online beforehand
Khafizov,2.8,3.4,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Calc 3 is hard but Khafizov made it even harder. Lecture consisted of him going off on tangents about theory until most everybody in the class was lost. Views everything from an engineering perspective. Went to his office hours to ask questions and he just kind of scoffed at me. Was able to make a good grade because of nothing but my own hard work.
Prasad,2.8,2.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Wouldn't suggest to take this course under this professor. This subject looks easy but its really tough to understand concepts when you have all marketing major students around you. I tried hard to enjoy and understand but failed

Johnston,3.7,2.2,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,Ridiculously easy class. Do the hw and go to lectures if you have questions. Johnston is obviously highly qualified in the field and incredibly skilled as a lecturer so listening to him is well worth it. Always there to answer questions and will even hold extra review sessions on popular demand. Do well on first 2 tests and the class is done.
Balanov,3.7,2.9,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Made second test significantly harder (majority of it was nothing like the sample exam and involved obscure integrals) because too many people were doing well without attending his not very helpful lectures.

WU,4.8,1.5,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,She focusses more on the basics and explains the concepts clearly. Tests are okay and assignments involve theory questions.

Not to mention you literally can't understand him due to his intense accent. Everyone feels awkward when he asks questions because no one actually knows what he's saying. His ""teaching"" style consists of reciting powerpoints on screen."
Wood,4.5,1.5,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Ms Wood is super cool and very smart. She really seems to care about her students and I learned a lot from her about writing college level essays. She seems to be interested in political stuff. Kind of radical

Thuraisingham,1.9,1.4,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Didn't learn anything y taking her class. Will never take any course under her again. There are many assignments but will learn nothing. Not at all helpful.
Sauerwald,5,3.6,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,I very much liked the discussions in class and the cases. Make sure to have enough time because the cases and the term project are time consuming. Great class if you put in the work!
Kiel,4.4,3.4,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,I've taken two classes with Dr. Kiel and I would wholeheartedly recommend taking any of his classes. He's an incredible lecturer and makes the class material very interesting. He has is extremely knowledgeable and has a lot to teach. You will have to attend class and work for your grades but it's completely worth it.
Whelan,4.5,2,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Urban Planning and Policy was a very interesting class. Professor Whelan really cares about his students and their performance. I really enjoyed his class. A ten page paper is required at the end of the semester but it's not too difficult.
Gurun,2.1,3.4,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Grade composition consists of 3 tests and a number of in-class quizzes. Professor has a decent sense of humor and can talk all day on the subject matter.  Class is enjoyable.
Humphreys,3.8,4,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,This class is really really hard. It doesn't even really prepare you for the FM exam. It just introduces you to the subject matter. Humphreys is a good teacher
Kroener,3.9,2.2,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,You have to know the slides really well. However

LI,4.3,3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Nice in class but condescending when it's 1 on 1. Only the 2nd week of school & she gets on to me as if I haven't touched the book. This is the only class I'm actually studying for. I told her I wasn't Vietnamese
McCuistion,3.3,3.2,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Loves to talk about himself and what he has accomplished/currently doing. Class lectures are pretty boring. Will call out on people and make rude comments

McNabb,2.5,3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Avoid this class if you want to learn something. Teaches nothing at all about portfolio and investment strategies. It's a more financial market class than investment class. Class contents are really unorganized. Surf through lots of webpages in class.
Smith,1.9,3.7,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Business & the Digital Arts with Nico is a fantastic class. He was technically the TA when I had him
Filbey,3.2,2.4,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,She stumbled over her words and often mixed up very simple pathways that are basic neuroscience. She questioned herself constantly
Ploski,4.3,2.5,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,Gave the A+
Hicks,4.2,1.3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Avoid this professor if you can. He never finishes a complete sentence without breaking his train of thought and saying something philosophical. He only gives 2 exams and a paper

Gable,5,3,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,"Awesome professor.  Took ""topics in software quality"" and ""software testing validation and verification"" course under him.

Nelson,4.4,2.5,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,All information is from the lecture
Lawson,4.9,2,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,Attendance is mandatory and classes are a drag. There is a lot of busy work to do outside of class and the assignments seem to be never ending.
Koshnevik,4.8,2,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,This class is supper easy to steal an A. No book required. No attendance either. All exams are the same if you have friends who took his classes last semester. You just Copy it & paste into your exams to get an easy 100. There are 3 exams

Tseng,3.1,3.5,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Great professor.  If you have a high interest in the material he steps your game up significantly.  He also allows quiz grades to be replaced by completed proofs of various topics.  If you manage to come to class ready to refine your knowledge of the chapter(s) being discussed
Kumas,4.9,3.2,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,ACCT 2301 is fun with Prof. Kumas. He makes it very easy to understand. I plan to switch to Accounting from engineering after talking to him. Tests are challenging

HE,2,1.8,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Very easy class. Sometimes it is hard to understand her but she is really sweet and I still managed to grasp the concepts with the help of the book.

Cohen,4,2.7,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,I have taken two classes with this professor and enjoyed both. He can get long-winded sometimes but only because he is passionate about what he does. He can come across like a know-it-all

Lewis,3.5,3.6,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Lewis is very demanding and can come off as rude. His tests are brutal but he gives a review. (just a list of terms you need to know) He has a SEATING CHART. Like elementary school. There is a quiz every class over chapters that he hasn't even gone over. I get that this is to make sure you read the material
Weiland,3.8,2,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Read the books
Namgoong,2.8,4.5,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,His teaching is pretty good. But
Jiang,5,4,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,"He is a very nice person and always helpful. I do not speak out a lot but he always encourages students to speak out in class.

XU,4,2.5,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,Great teacher! Previous comment is not quite correct. Yes
Dorsey,4.8,2.5,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Very approachable but does a lot of things during his teaching that he tells you not to do in your teaching. Very serious guy but occasionally he will say something funny.
Nowacki,3,3,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,The overall course is hard but a very interesting approach to learning. He uses real life examples to teach which is very nice compared to only theory. He has a tremendous  amount of knowledge to share.

Menon,3.1,3.8,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,You are expected to know Statistics and BI to fair well in this course. Take this course if you are genuinely interested in learning BI in depth. Professor is very helpful and quick at responding to emails. Tests are tough but he curves a lot. Around 25 students got A in the class. You learn a lot about different models and SAS programming.

Assaad,5,2.4,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,Probably the best math teacher (assistant) I've ever had for linear algebra. He explains concepts perfectly and makes the exams were easy to study for. Definitely recommend a class that has him as a TA even if he's not the main teacher. Most of our class went through linear algebra just learning everything through his problem sessions.
Muharremoglu,3.9,3.1,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Worst professor you can possibly take. The class is difficult because his explanations are very unclear. Lectures make students confused and the only way to do well is to read the book. Exams are worth 75% of your grade. He is just there to collect a paycheck

Braun,1.5,4,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,The reading is the easiest part. and luckily the quiz questions are directly from the textbook. You would think this makes the class simple..WRONG. I read the chapter each week and locate the answer WORD FOR WORD in the book when I quiz but I somehow still make between 65-80. If you like passing...DO NOT TAKE. I do not recommend this professor.
Kaan,3.8,2.7,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Thank you Dr. Kaan. If I have a job today it was because of you and the course you thought. I knew nothing about it and after class the thing I learned helped me find my dream job. I hope I can see you and personally thank you! You are an awesome professor. You are the only one that I admire at UT Dallas.

Warren,4.8,2,/assets/chilis/new-hot-chili.png,,She's awesome.

Burnett,4,3,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,I hate history but she has made the material a little more interesting in her class. She's a good lecturer.

Oladimeji,3.9,2.9,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,He's a really good teacher! If you have the option to take this class DO IT.

Loving,3.8,1.6,/assets/chilis/cold-chili.png,,Ive taken 2 classes with Loving and earned an A in both. Assignments are easy and very clear.
