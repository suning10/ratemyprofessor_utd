       "  [u\"Chemistry in itself wasn't a hard class. However, if you take Sibert, you'll make your life harder. His lectures aren't half bad but if you want to do good on the class, you need to take a lot of time outside of lecture and teach yourself.\",\n",
       "   u\"Lectures are very cut and dry and often times irrelevant to material you need to know. Lots of practice outside of class is essential to passing. Everyone raves about him, and he's a nice guy, but is just generally not a good lecturer. Also tends to cram all material we missed the day before our exams. Would not recommend taking him.\",\n",
       "   u'Sibert is an entertaining lecturer but I prefer more structure. If you want a professor who can teach you and keep up AND still have time to review the material and give practice questions, take Nielson or McCafee. Sibert goes very slow and I basically stopped attending all lectures. Do the practice questions, read the textbook and get an A.',\n",
       "   u\"Dr. Sibert is a very cool professor, he's accomplished so much, he's also really passionate about what he teaches. I would def recommend him. only bad thing about him is that he usually doesn't post his notes, and may seem a little disorganized at times. but overall he's great and very helpful, i never even used the textbook\",\n",
       "   u\"Although the class in general was tough since I didn't take Chemistry since sophomore year of high school, John Siberts passion with chemistry and lecturing kept me awake even at the most grueling subjects. His ability to relate complex topics to simple things and even his own life stories make him a professor to desire.  TL;DR Get him if you can\",\n",
       "   u\"Professor Sibert is very straightforward when it comes to what you need to know for the exams, and his clearness in explaining the material is unparalleled by the other teachers. However, that's only when he's there, as this past semester, he was often in Europe, right around testing time.\",\n",
       "   u\"Sibert will sometimes spend an entire lecture talking about some random, but still chemistry related topic. If you read the book, class isn't mandatory, but he gives random in-class exercises that consist of doing one example problems. Those only really occur when he feels there should have been more people in class though.\",\n",
       "   u\"By hotness I mean how attractive he is. He's the type of person to talk to about life but not Chem. He's lectures are interesting but he barely teaches Chem, so it's up to you to prepare for the tests.\",\n",
       "   u\"Although Sibert does go in tangents about the history of a idea in chem, he's very clear/straightforward in his lectures. The style he uses is very conversational, which has always kept me very interested in the subject and made me understand WHY we are learning something. But be SURE to do work out of class. He mostly just explains the concepts.\",\n",
       "   u\"Sibert has notes that he puts up while speaking. Great at explaining concepts. Reading is required to pass this class OR just doing homework problems! Good lecturer. Don't go to his office hours -he's a meanie.\",\n",
       "   u\"I took Dr. Sibert for 1312 because I heard good things from other students and it turned it was the complete opposite. So I decided to give him another chance for ochem in the summer, but it was the same. He's really knowledgeable, but he's hard to get a hold of. I honestly learned more from the textbook than the lectures themselves.\",\n",
       "   u'Definitely a great professor. Had Taylor for the fall semester and I would say Sibert is much better. His lectures are very straightforward, and he writes everything he says down in a very clear manner. Does plenty of examples. I never read out of the textbook, but just studied his lecture and ALEKS notes.',\n",
       "   u\"Sibert tends to cram most of the exam material on the day before the exam. Be prepared to read the textbook and learn all of the information yourself. Do the homework problems and sign up for PLTL. An A is very possible. Sibert's lectures are not mandatory and if you do skip, just keep up with the material yourself.\",\n",
       "   u'Sibert usually covers concepts and background information, with extra lectures that cover example problems with detailed explanations. His classes score consistently higher than the other sections. He does have a tendency to rush in the days before a test, and rarely is all the material covered in the primary lecture. He might be a psychopath.',\n",
       "   u'NEVER AGAIN. He rambles on and on. Class never helped. I skipped lecture for the second exam and did much better than the first when i actually went to class. He crams things the day of the exam. Nice and funny, but teaching needs improvement. You have to do a lot of reading on your own.',\n",
       "   u'Dr. Sibert rocks! He explains things really well and expects you to read and study for tests on your own time. Aside from that, he makes everything really relatable and easy to understand. Definitely recommend.',\n",
       "   u\"He's a great lecturer, but it's really up to you to get ready for the tests. I would say he was the best Gen Chem I professor. At the same time, it's really best to read the book and do practice exams for the tests.\",\n",
       "   u\"Many students consider Gen Chem I to be somewhat hard but if you really pay attention to Sibert's Lectures, you'll realize that he is excellent at explaining concepts and how to do the problemsexamples. I liked Sibert so much I decided to take him again for Gen Chem II.\",\n",
       "   u\"Hard class but I always look forward to coming to Dr. Sibert's class. The only drawback is that he has a tendency to cram last minute topics the day before a test.\",\n",
       "   u'I took him during Summer 2012. Understand the homework, make sure you can do the homework and you will be fine. If he does not lecture about a certain topic, you will not see it on the test. Exam questions are not harder than homework questions. Very fair professor.']),\n",

GREAT professor, he really knows calculus.',\n",
       "   u\"The class  is boring, but it is calculus so that is what you can expect.  Doing the homework is important for getting a good grade.  The last two tests had a review so that helped a little.  There is a quiz every class period, if you can learn better on your own then you don't need to stay for class.  It helped me just to go through the book myself\",\n",

I would highly recommend him.  I was scared of Calculus but he made it look easy and it made sense to me.. Good teacher!!!',\n",

He is actually employed at CCCC and does part time at UTD when they can't find a person for certain time slots. He blows through the material as fast as he can so he can leave. Waste of your money, STAY AWAY!!!!\",\n",

His test questions are usually straight from the homework but the cumulative final was pretty tricky, it had different stuff then what we reviewed. It's calculus so you can't expect to have fun, I would recommend this teacher.\",\n",

The lecture then does what it is supposed to do, thoroughly embeds the material.\",\n",

The exams are concept-driven and usually taken from lecture material. She's very accommodating but the material is inherently difficult and students fall chronically behind.\",\n",
       "   u\"Very easy going, lot's of second chances. Lecture quality varied as did test difficulty. The class felt like it was a bit too easy, or maybe that's just me being pretentious and narcissistic. Anyways, no risk in taking her class, it's even fun sometimes.\",\n",

Her notes, however, are confusing and unhelpful, but she curves averages generously at the end.\",\n",

Definitely pay close attention in class or your notes can become confusing and meaningless.\",\n",
